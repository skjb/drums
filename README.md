# Drum Sheet Music

This is a collection of songs I have transcribed into sheet music.

This is a tedious process that involves listening to songs repeatedly and recording what I think is being played by the drummer.

Since songs are generally pretty noisy it is often difficult to accurately determine the exact notes being played, so there will be errors.

I am also not an extremely proficient drummer, so sometimes I will simplify a song to suit my needs.

I have provided the sheet music in PDF format, but also the original [MuseScore 2](https://musescore.org/) format so you can rework them yourself. MuseScore 2 is free music composition software.

Please appreciate the level of effort I have put into these transcriptions by sending people to this page, or by [donating](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=Y3FMH5E8HEPPW).
